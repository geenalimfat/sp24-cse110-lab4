1. The bug is that the vars `num1` and `num2` are `string` types when they are accessed by the document. This means that when the code tries to add the two together to get the sum, it will parse the strings together. So '1' and '2' will be '12' instead of 3.
2. To fix this code so it will work as intended, I would change the type of `num1` and `num2` when we are adding them to assign them to result. I did this by using the `Number()` function and called it on both variables before adding them together. The code now looks like: `let result = Number(num1) + Number(num2)`(refer to screenshot)
